# snap2zombie

Import a [try-runtime](https://github.com/paritytech/try-runtime-cli) snapshot into [zombienet](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet)

# Install

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/tmpolaczyk/snap2zombie --locked
```

# Usage

```
snap2zombie create-snapshot --uri wss://dancebox.tanssi-api.network:443 dancebox-2025-04-01.snap
snap2zombie to-hex-snap --snapshot-path dancebox-2025-04-01.snap --output-path dancebox-2025-04-01.hexsnap.txt --pallet PooledStaking
snap2zombie merge-into-raw --chain-spec-path dancebox-raw-spec.json --hex-snapshot-path dancebox-2025-04-01.hexsnap.txt --output-path dancebox-raw-spec-snap.json --pallet PooledStaking
```

And now just use `dancebox-raw-spec-snap.json` in zombienet

Creating a snapshot for dancebox takes 7 minutes as of 2025-04-04

# Subcommands

## create-snapshot

This is just a re-export of the `try-runtime create-snapshot` command, included for convenience and to avoid issues with different snapshot versions.
Since the latest commit in `try-runtime` repo is from 6 months ago, you probably have the latest version already installed and you can use `try-runtime` for the snapshot.

## to-hex-snap

Extracts the raw key-values from the snapshot file, and saves it using a "hex snapshot" format.

[Snapshot](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/f5de39196e8c30de4bc47a2d46b1a0fe1e9aaee0/substrate/utils/frame/remote-externalities/src/lib.rs#L66) struct

```rust
const SNAPSHOT_VERSION: SnapshotVersion = Compact(4);

/// The snapshot that we store on disk.
#[derive(Decode, Encode)]
struct Snapshot<B: BlockT> {
	snapshot_version: SnapshotVersion,
	state_version: StateVersion,
	// <Vec<Key, (Value, MemoryDbRefCount)>>
	raw_storage: Vec<(Vec<u8>, (Vec<u8>, i32))>,
	// The storage root of the state. This may vary from the storage root in the header, if not the
	// entire state was fetched.
	storage_root: B::Hash,
	header: B::Header,
}
```

Here you can see the `raw_storage` field which looks like a `Vec<(Key, Value)>`, but it's actually not. Trying to use that directly doesn't work.
The keys are almost the same as the actual keys except for the last portion, but the values are very different. I guess its some trie-db format.
If we had a way to decode this without using `ext` code, it would simplify this tool a lot.

The resulting hex snapshot file looks like this:

```
"0x012345": "0xaabbccdd",
"0x012346": "0xbbdd",
```

The idea is to be able to copy-paste it easily into the raw chain spec file.

## merge-into-raw

This command does a smart copy-paste from the hex snapshot into the raw chain spec file.
It is smart because before inserting the new values it first removes all the storage from the selected pallets.

## pad-with-spaces

This is a hack to artificially increase chain spec file size, because if the output file size is less than 2GB, zombienet will attempt to modify it and that may fail.
I believe the limit of RAM usage for a node.js program is 1.5 GB, and because of the way zombienet reads the chain spec file, it probably will crash if the chain spec
is more than 0.8 GB, because it needs to store in memory both the raw string as well as the deserialized object, and then it serializes it again into a string.
